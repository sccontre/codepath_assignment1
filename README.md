### Notes
The only challenge I can recall is forgetting to set the starting screen after switching to the tab navigation. This caused me to be confused because of a blank screen on loading. In the future, I'm sure this issue can be avoided by compiling and running code more often to avoid making small mistakes harder to find.

### Notes
The only challenge I truly faced while completing this assignment was that the videos had an outdated interface for XCode which caused some confusion when attempting to follow along with them.
